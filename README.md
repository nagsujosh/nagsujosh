## 🌱 About Me

I’m a **junior in Computer Science** with strong interests in **robotics, reinforcement learning, and systems engineering**.  
I enjoy working across the stack—from **low-level systems and robotics control** to **machine learning pipelines and product-driven applications**.

My long-term goal is to pursue a **PhD focused on Imitation Learning and Robotics**, while continuing to build tools and products that operate reliably in the real world.

- 🎓 **B.S. Computer Science**, University of New Hampshire (Expected 2027)
- 🤖 Research interests: **Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Robotics, Vision-Language Models**
- 🧠 Enjoys blending **theory + implementation**
- 🏗️ Builder mindset: research code, production systems, and user-facing products

## 🧠 Systems & Software

### 🧳 **Lost & Found Platform**

**Repo:** [`cattracker`](https://github.com/nagsujosh/cattracker)
A **cloud-native, ticket-driven platform** for university lost-and-found operations.
Designed with a modular backend and deployable serverless components.

* CRUD workflows for lost/found items
* Searchable item metadata with status tracking
* Containerized development setup

**Tech:** Azure Functions · Python · MongoDB · Docker · HTML/CSS · JavaScript

---

### 🎧 **Your Daily Podcaster**

**Repo:** [`your-daily-podcaster`](https://github.com/nagsujosh/your-daily-podcaster)
An **automated content pipeline** that crawls sources, summarizes them with LLMs, converts them to audio, and publishes a daily podcast.

* End-to-end automation (crawl → summarize → TTS → publish)
* CI-driven execution with logging and observability
* Designed as a reproducible pipeline, not a script

**Tech:** Python · LLM APIs · TTS · GitHub Actions
